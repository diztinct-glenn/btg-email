To Do:

-Look into Sendgrid tags, specifically Update Preferences
-Thunderbird Fonts not rendering
-Social Icons Don't have margins in outlook

-Try Different Colors on Header and Footer


Notes:

-gmail strips classes and ids
-look into image hosting, specifically how much hits imgur.com can take in a day
-If you add margin or padding properties to your TABLE element, it will add that same margin and padding to every nested TD in Outlook 2007 and 2010. Cellpadding and cellspacing attributes are safe but it's best to avoid CSS margins and padding within the containing TABLE element.
